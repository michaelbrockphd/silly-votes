Front ends:
- fe-api (microservice providing the API all front ends implement).
- fe-web-react (built in react)
- May build another but in Angular.

Back end:
- be-auth-dev (small microservice to simulate authentication)
- be-campaigns (small microservice to handle campaigns)
- be-votes (small microservice to handle votes)
    - Will build this one later - focusing on finishing campaigns first.
    - This is so at least something can be put to Azure for practice.

Database:
- db-mongo
